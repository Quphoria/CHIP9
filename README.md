# CHIP 9 Emulator
### This is my work for the 2019 X-MAS CTF CHIP9 EMULATOR
*I would like to thank the Organiser MILKDROP for their help on an issue with the half carry bit for subtraction*

The original python code is in the chip9-emulator folder, I recommend using the patched bootroom "bootrom0" as a loop in the original bootrom was very slow in python.

I rewrote it in C# in the CHIP9 C EMU folder, using the Windows Presentation Foundation
Prebuilt binaries are in the bin folder

All roms in the DEMOS folder are the work of other teams, all rights reserved to the respective teams
