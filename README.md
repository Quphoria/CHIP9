# This is my work for the 2019 X-MAS ctf
### I would like to thank MILKDROP for their help with an issue for the half carry bit for subtraction__

The original python code is in the chip9-emulator folder, I recommend using the patched bootroom "bootrom0" as a loop in the original bootrom was very slow in python.

I rewrote it in C# in the CHIP9 C EMU folder, using the Windows Presentation Foundation
Prebuilt binaries are in the bin folder

All roms in the DEMOS folder are the work of other teams, all rights reserved to the respective teams
